# File overview
So you don't need to sift.

## hpl_analysis
Folder containing the code I used to read and sort run results in a nice format.

## SmallTests
HPL runs that didn't make the final cut (because they weren't fast enough).

## FINAL_RESULT
The best run we had. There were two runs done on that file, but the top run at ~1467.7 GFLOPs was the best.

## Make.armclang, hpl_armclang.sbatch
Build and run scripts.
